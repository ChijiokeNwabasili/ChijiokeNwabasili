I'm Chijioke Nwabasili, a **Frontend Web Developer** with with hands-on experience building responsive, accessible, and performance-focused websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I focus on turning designs into clear, usable interfaces that guide users, support business goals, and work reliably across devices.
